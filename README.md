### background 
Space Invaders is an arcade game that has marked the era of modern computer games.
The game has two main characters that are the player and the aliens.
When the new game button is pressed, the aliens come from the top of the screen and advance towards the player. The object of the player (Buzz Lightyear) is to stop them with his terrifying laser beam, the player can move left and right. At the same time the invaders are throwing bombs that threaten to destroy the player and as the game continues they get closer, more threatening and their impact is greater.
Every three stages of the game the player receives a bonus of one "life" in addition to the number of life he had before. At each stage the speed of the aliens (height and width) increases and the frequency of their shooting increases. If one of the alien bombs hits a player, one life goes down. If the aliens manage to reach the red line above the player, the number of life left for the player will not be meaningful and the game will end immediately. Each player's injury to one of the aliens entitles the player to score 250 points and score as many points as possible and eliminate as many aliens as possible.
